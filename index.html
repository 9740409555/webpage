 <p> A hobby is something which one loves to do in his/her leisure time.
    Different people have different hobbies.
    My favorite hobby is reading books.
    I spend my leisure time reading all types of books.
    Literature is my favorite genre. ...Why is reading the best?
    Reading at home boosts school performance later on. It also increases vocabulary, raises self-esteem, builds good communication skills, and strengthens the prediction engine that is the human brain
